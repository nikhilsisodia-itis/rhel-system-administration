# Setting the Default Systemd Target in RHEL 10

## Introduction to Systemd Targets

- Systemd targets are used to define the state of the system and manage services during boot and shutdown processes.
- In RHEL 10, the default systemd target determines the state of the system after booting. You can set or change the default target using the `systemctl` command.

## Here’s how to do it

1. **Check the Current Default Target**:
    - `systemctl get-default`: This will display the current default target, such as `graphical.target` or `multi-user.target`.
2. **Set a New Default Target**:
    - `sudo systemctl set-default <target-name>`: Replace `<target-name>` with the desired target, such as `graphical.target` or `multi-user.target`.
3. **Verify the Change:**
    - `systemctl get-default`: This command will confirm that the default target has been updated successfully.
4. **Reboot the System**:
    - `sudo reboot`: Restart the system to apply the new default target.
5. **Post-Reboot Verification**:
    - After the system reboots, you can verify that it has booted into the desired target by checking the current target:
    - `systemctl get-default`: This will show the target the system has booted into.

- This command will confirm that the default target has been updated successfully.
- By following these steps, you can easily manage the default systemd target in RHEL 10 to suit your system's needs.
