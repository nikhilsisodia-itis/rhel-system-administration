# Using Journald

## Introduction

- `journald` is a system service that collects and stores logging data.
- It is part of the `systemd` suite and provides a centralized logging mechanism for system and application logs.
- `journald` stores logs in a binary format, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval.
- It supports structured logging, making it easier to filter and analyze log data.
- `journald` can be configured to forward logs to other logging systems, such as `syslog` or external log management services.
- It provides various tools for querying and viewing logs, such as `journalctl`.
- `journald` can be configured to manage log rotation and retention policies, ensuring that logs do not consume excessive disk space.
- It supports various log levels, allowing users to filter logs based on their severity.
- `journald` can capture logs from various sources, including kernel messages, system services, and user applications.
- It provides integration with other `systemd` components, allowing for seamless logging across the entire system.

## Basic Commands

- `journalctl`: View and query logs stored by `journald`.
- `journalctl -b`: View logs from the current boot.
- `journalctl -u <service>`: View logs for a specific service.
- `journalctl --since "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`: View logs since a specific date and time.
- `journalctl --until "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`: View logs until a specific date and time.
- `journalctl -f`: Follow new log entries in real-time.
- `journalctl -p <priority>`: Filter logs by priority level (e.g., `emerg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`).
- `journalctl --disk-usage`: Show the disk space used by journal files.
- `systemctl restart systemd-journald`: Restart the `journald` service.
- `systemctl status systemd-journald`: Check the status of the `journald` service.
- `journalctl --output=json`: Output logs in JSON format for easier parsing.
- `journalctl --list-boots`: List all recorded boots with their IDs and timestamps.
- `journalctl --verify`: Verify the integrity of the journal files.
- `journalctl --rotate`: Rotate the journal files manually.
- `journalctl --flush`: Flush the journal to disk, ensuring all in-memory logs are written.
