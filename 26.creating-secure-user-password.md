# Creating a secure user password

## Commands to createa a secure user password

- Creating a user password:

1. Using the `openSSL` command to generate a secure password hash:

- This command generates a SHA-512 hashed password, which is more secure than traditional MD5 or DES hashes.
  - Use `openssl passwd -6 '<password>'` to generate a secure password hash.
    - Example: `openssl passwd -6 'MySecureP@ssw0rd'`
  - Use `useradd -p <hashed_password> <username>` to create a user with the hashed password.
    - Example: `useradd -p '$6$randomsalt$hashedpassword' newuser`
  - Use `usermod -p <hashed_password> <username>` to update an existing user's password.
    - Example: `usermod -p '$6$randomsalt$hashedpassword' existinguser`

1. Using the `passwd` command to change a user's password:

- This command is used to change a user's password interactively.
  - Use `passwd <username>` to change the password for a specific user.
    - Example: `passwd newuser`
- The system will prompt you to enter the new password and confirm it.
- This method is suitable for interactive use and ensures that the password is securely entered without being displayed on the screen.
