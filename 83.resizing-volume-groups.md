# Resizing Volume Groups

- You can resize a volume group by adding or removing physical volumes.
- This is useful when you need to increase or decrease the storage capacity of your volume group.

## Adding Physical Volumes

To add a physical volume to a volume group, use the `vgextend` command:

```bash
vgextend <volume_group> /dev/<new_physical_volume>
```

## Removing Physical Volumes

To remove a physical volume from a volume group, use the `vgreduce` command:

```bash
vgreduce <volume_group> /dev/<physical_volume>
```

- Before removing a physical volume, ensure that the data is migrated to other physical volumes in the group using the `pvmove` command:

```bash
pvmove /dev/<physical_volume>
```

- After migrating the data, you can safely remove the physical volume from the volume group.

```bash
vgreduce <volume_group> /dev/<physical_volume>
```
