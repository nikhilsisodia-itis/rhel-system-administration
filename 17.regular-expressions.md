# Applying Regular Expressions

## Introduction to Regular Expressions

- Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are sequences of characters that form search patterns.
- They are used for pattern matching within strings, allowing for complex search and replace operations.

## Basic Syntax

- Literal characters: Match themselves (e.g., `a` matches "a").
- Metacharacters: Special characters that have specific meanings (e.g., `.` matches any character).
- Character classes: Define a set of characters (e.g., `[abc]` matches "a", "b", or "c").
- Quantifiers: Specify how many times a character or group can occur (e.g., `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n,m}`).
- Anchors: Indicate positions in the string (e.g., `^` for start, `$` for end).
- Groups and ranges: Parentheses `()` for grouping and `|` for alternation (e.g., `(abc|def)` matches "abc" or "def").
- Escape sequences: Use `\` to escape metacharacters (e.g., `\.` matches a literal dot).
- Flags: Modify the behavior of the regex (e.g., `i` for case-insensitive, `g` for global search).
