# Introduction to File Ownership

## What is File Ownership?

- File ownership is a fundamental concept in Linux that determines who has control over a file or directory.
- Every file and directory is owned by a user and a group.
- Ownership affects permissions and access control.

## Key Concepts

- **User**: The user who owns the file. This user has specific permissions to read, write, or execute the file.
- **Group**: The group that owns the file. Members of this group have specific permissions to read, write, or execute the file.
- **Root User**: The superuser in Linux who has unrestricted access to all files and commands.
- **Permissions**: Define what actions the user, group-members, and others can perform on the file (read, write, execute).
