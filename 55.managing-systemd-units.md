# Managing Systemd Services

## How to manage systemd units?

- Systemd units are also called services.
- To manage systemd units, you can use the `systemctl` command.
- Systemd uses unit files to define units, which are typically located in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/lib/systemd/system/`.

- `systemctl -t help`: Show help for `systemctl`.
- `systemctl list-units`: List all active units.
- `systemctl list-unit-files`: List all unit files and their states.
- `systemctl status <unit>`: Show the status of a specific unit.
- `systemctl start <unit>`: Start a specific unit.
- `systemctl stop <unit>`: Stop a specific unit.
- `systemctl restart <unit>`: Restart a specific unit.
- `systemctl enable <unit>`: Enable a unit to start at boot.
- `systemctl disable <unit>`: Disable a unit from starting at boot.
- `systemctl daemon-reload`: Reload the `systemd` manager configuration.
- `systemctl is-active <unit>`: Check if a unit is active.
- `systemctl is-enabled <unit>`: Check if a unit is enabled.
