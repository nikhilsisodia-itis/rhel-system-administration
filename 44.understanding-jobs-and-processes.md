# Understanding Jobs and Processes

## What is a Process?

- All tasks are started as processes.
- A process is an instance of a running program.
- Each process has a unique Process ID (PID).
- Processes can be in the foreground or background.
- Common Process Management tasks including scheduling priority and sending signals.
- Tasks that are started from a shell can be managed as jobs.
- Shell jobs can be moved between the foreground and background.
- Jobs can be managed by an individual user (owner), and can be suspended or terminated.
- Processes can be managed by the system administrator (root user), and can be prioritized, suspended, or terminated.
