# Introduction to AWK

## What is AWK?

- AWK in Linux is a powerful text processing and pattern scanning language.
- It is named after its 3 creators.
- AWK is commonly used for pattern scanning and processing, making it ideal for tasks like data extraction, reporting, and text manipulation.
- It operates on a line-by-line basis, making it easy to process large text files.
- AWK is available on most Unix-like operating systems and can be used in shell scripts or directly from the command line.

## Basic Syntax

- An AWK program consists of a series of patterns and actions.
- The general syntax is:

  ```awk 'pattern { action }' input_file
  ```

  - Example:

    ```bash
    awk '/error/ { print $0 }' logfile.txt
    ```

    This command searches for lines containing the word "error" in `logfile.txt` and prints those lines.
- If the pattern matches a line, the corresponding action is executed.
- If no pattern is specified, the action is applied to all lines.
- If no action is specified, the default action is to print the entire line.
- AWK scripts can be written in a file and executed using the `-f` option.

## Fields and Records

- AWK treats each line of input as a record and each word or column in the line as a field.
- By default, fields are separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs), but you can change the field separator using the `-F` option.
- Fields are accessed using `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc., where `$1` is the first field, `$2` is the second field, and so on.
- `$0` represents the entire line (record).
- Example:  

  ```bash
  awk '{ print $1, $3 }' data.txt
  ```

  This command prints the first and third fields of each line in `data.txt`.
- You can also use built-in variables like `NF` (number of fields) and `NR` (number of records) to get information about the current line being processed.
- Example:

  ```bash
  awk '{ print "Line number:", NR, "has", NF, "fields." }' data.txt
  ```

  This command prints the line number and the number of fields for each line in `data.txt`.
- You can change the output field separator using the `OFS` variable.
- Example:

  ```bash
  awk 'BEGIN { OFS="," } { print $1, $2, $3 }' data.txt
  ```

  This command prints the first three fields of each line in `data.txt`, separated by commas.
- The `BEGIN` block is executed before processing any input lines, making it useful for setting variables or printing headers.
- The `END` block is executed after all input lines have been processed, making it useful for printing summaries or final results.
- Example:

  ```bash
  awk 'END { print "Total lines processed:", NR }' data.txt
  ```

  This command prints the total number of lines processed in `data.txt`.
