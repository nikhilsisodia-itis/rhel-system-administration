# Introduction to Stratis Snapshots

## What is a Stratis Snapshots?

- A Stratis snapshot is a point‑in‑time copy of a filesystem’s metadata.
- It allows you to access state of the snapshot at any time.
- It makes the filesystem appear as it did at the moment the snapshot was taken.
- A snapshot is mounted by its device name, not by its UUID.
