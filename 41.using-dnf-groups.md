# Introduction to DNF Groups

## What are DNF Groups?

- DNF groups are collections of related packages that serve a common purpose or function.
- They simplify the installation of multiple packages by allowing users to install a group instead of individual packages.
- Examples of DNF groups include "Development Tools", "Web Server", and "Graphical Administration Tools".
- DNF groups are defined in the repository metadata and can be managed using the `dnf` command.
- Using DNF groups can help ensure that all necessary dependencies and related tools are installed together.
- DNF groups are particularly useful for setting up specific environments or roles on a system.
- They can be installed, removed, and listed using specific `dnf` commands.

- `dnf group list --installed`: Lists all DNF groups that are currently installed on the system.
- `dnf group list --available`: Lists all DNF groups that are available for installation.
- `dnf group list --hidden`: Lists all hidden DNF groups that are not shown by default.
