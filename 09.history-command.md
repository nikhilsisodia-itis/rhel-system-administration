# The History command

## Description

- The `history` command in Bash is used to display the command history of the current shell session. It shows a list of previously executed commands along with their corresponding line numbers.
- This command is useful for recalling and re-executing commands without having to retype them.
- The history is typically stored in a file (e.g., `~/.bash_history`) and can be configured to retain a certain number of commands.
- You can also use the `history` command to search for specific commands, delete entries, or clear the entire history.
- The `HISTSIZE` and `HISTFILESIZE` environment variables can be set to control the number of commands stored in memory and in the history file, respectively.
- The `history` command can be combined with other commands and options to enhance its functionality, such as using `!` to re-execute a command by its number or using `grep` to filter the history output.
- Example usage:
  - `history` - Displays the entire command history.
  - `history 10` - Displays the last 10 commands.
  - `!n` - Re-executes the command with line number `n`.
  - `history -c` - Clears the entire command history.
  - `history -w` - Writes the current session's history to the history file.
  - `history -d n` - Deletes the command with line number `n` from the history.
