# Special File Permissions in Linux Systems

## What are Special File Permissions?

Special file permissions in RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) are extra permissions that can be set on files and directories, in addition to the standard read, write, and execute permissions. These special permissions are:

### 1. SUID (Set User ID)

- **What it does:** When a file with SUID is executed, it runs with the permissions of the file owner, not the user who runs it.
- **Example:**  
  If a file owned by `root` has SUID set, any user running that file will execute it with `root` privileges.
- **How to set:**  

  ```bash
  chmod u+s filename
  ```

- **How it looks:**  
  `-rwsr-xr-x` (the `s` in place of owner's execute bit)
- **Example command:**  

  ```bash
  ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
  ```

  Output:  
  `-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/bin/passwd`

### 2. SGID (Set Group ID)

- **What it does:**  
  - On files: When executed, the process runs with the group permissions of the file.
  - On directories: New files created inside inherit the directory's group.
- **How to set:**  

  ```bash
  chmod g+s directoryname
  ```

- **How it looks:**  
  - File: `-rwxr-sr-x` (the `s` in place of group execute bit)
  - Directory: `drwxr-sr-x`
- **Example command:**

  ```bash
  mkdir shared
  chmod g+s shared
  ls -ld shared
  ```

  Output:  
  `drwxr-sr-x 2 user group ... shared`

### 3. Sticky Bit

- **What it does:**  
  Only the file owner, directory owner, or root can delete or rename files within that directory.
- **Common use:**  
  Used on `/tmp` so users can't delete each other's files.
- **How to set:**  

  ```bash
  chmod +t directoryname
  ```

- **How it looks:**  
  `drwxrwxrwt` (the `t` at the end)
- **Example command:**  

  ```bash
  ls -ld /tmp
  ```

  Output:  
  `drwxrwxrwt 10 root root ... /tmp`

**Summary Table:**

| Permission | Symbol | Set With         | Typical Use         |
|------------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| SUID       | s      | chmod u+s file   | Run as file owner   |
| SGID       | s      | chmod g+s dir    | Inherit group/Run as group |
| Sticky Bit | t      | chmod +t dir     | Protect files in dir|
