# Creating LVM

## How to create LVM?

- Create a physical volume (PV) on a disk or partition:

  ```bash
  sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX1
  ```

- Create a volume group (VG) using the physical volume:

  ```bash
  sudo vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdX1
  ```

- Create a logical volume (LV) within the volume group:

  ```bash
  sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n my_lv my_vg
  ```

- Format the logical volume with a file system (e.g., ext4):

  ```bash
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv
  ```

- Create a mount point and mount the logical volume:

  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/my_mount_point
  sudo mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt/my_mount_point
  ```

- To make the mount persistent across reboots, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:

  ```bash
  /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt/my_mount_point ext4 defaults 0 2
  ```

- Verify the logical volume is mounted:

  ```bash
  df -h
  ```

- You can also use `lsblk` to view the logical volumes and their mount points:

  ```bash
  lsblk
  ```
