# Creating Swap Partitions

## What is Swap?

- Swap space is a portion of a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD) that is used as virtual memory when the physical RAM is fully utilized.
- It helps to improve system performance by providing additional memory resources.
- Swap space can be in the form of a dedicated swap partition or a swap file.

## Creating a Swap Partition

- To create a swap partition, you can use tools like `fdisk`, `parted`, or `gparted`.
- Here is a basic example using `fdisk`:

1. Open a terminal and run `sudo fdisk /dev/sdX` (replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual disk).
2. Create a new partition by typing `n` and following the prompts.
3. Change the partition type to swap by typing `t` and entering the code `82`.
4. Write the changes to the disk by typing `w`.
5. Format the partition as swap using the command `sudo mkswap /dev/sdXn` (replace `/dev/sdXn` with your actual partition).
6. Activate the swap partition with `sudo swapon /dev/sdXn`.
7. To make the swap partition permanent, add it to `/etc/fstab`:

   ```bash
   /dev/sdXn  none  swap  sw  0  0
   ```

## Verifying Swap

- You can verify that the swap space is active using the command `swapon --show` or `free -h`.
- To check the status of all mounted filesystems, including swap, you can use:

  ```bash
  sudo findmnt --verify --verbose
  ```
  
- This command will display detailed information about all mounted filesystems and verify their integrity.
