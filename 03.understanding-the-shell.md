# Understanding the Shell

## What is a Shell?

- A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands.
- It acts as an intermediary or medium between the user and the system, interpreting user inputs and translating them into actions, that is then performed by the OS.
- There are various types of shells available in Linux, with the most common being the Bourne Again Shell (bash), Z Shell (zsh), and C Shell (csh).
- The Standard Graphical Shell- GNOME.

## What is Virtual Terminal?

- A virtual terminal (VT) is a terminal emulator that allows users to access multiple terminal sessions within a single physical terminal.
- It provides a way to switch between different command-line sessions without the need for multiple physical terminals.
- Virtual terminals are commonly used in Linux systems and can be accessed using key combinations (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6).
- `who` command can be used to display information about users who are currently logged in to the system.
- `w` command provides a more detailed view of currently logged-in users and their activity.
- `chvt` stands for Change Virtual Terminal. This command is used to change the active virtual terminal.
  - Example: `chvt 3` switches to the third virtual terminal.

**Note: `chvt` can only be used with `sudo`.**

- To close a virtual terminal session, you can use the `exit` command or press `Ctrl + D` in the virtual terminal, and switch to another virtual terminal using `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to `F6`.
