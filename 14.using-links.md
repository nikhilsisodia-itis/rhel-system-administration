# Links

## Introduction to Links

- Links are pointers that refer to files or directories in the filesystem.
- Links are ways to create shortcuts or alternate names for files and directories in Linux.
- They help you access the same file from different places without copying it.

## Types of Links

- There are two types of links in Linux: hard links and symbolic (soft) links.

### Hard Links

- A hard link is like giving a file another name.
- Both names point directly to the same data on disk (the same inode).
- If you delete one name, the file still exists as long as another hard link points to it.
- Hard links only work for files (not directories) and must be on the same filesystem.
- You can create a hard link using the `ln` command without any options.
- Example: `ln original.txt hardlink.txt` creates a hard link named `hardlink.txt` pointing to `original.txt`.

### Symbolic Links

- A soft link (or symbolic link, or symlink) is like a shortcut.
- It points to the name of another file or directory.
- If the original file is deleted, the symlink becomes broken (it points to nothing).
- Symlinks can link to files or directories, and can cross filesystems.
- You can create a symbolic link using the `ln -s` command.
- Example: `ln -s /path/to/original.txt symlink.txt` creates a symlink named `symlink.txt` pointing to `original.txt`.
**NOTE:** Relatives parts are required in the creation of Symbolic Links.

## Viewing Links

- The `ls -l` command is used to see details about files, including links.
- Example: `ls -l` will show a list of files with their permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
- The `ls -i` command shows the inode number of files, which can help identify hard links.
- Example: `ls -i filename` will display the inode number of `filename`.
- In the output, a symbolic link will show an arrow (`->`) pointing to the target file.
- Example output: `lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 11 Sep 1 12:00 symlink.txt -> /path/to/original.txt`
- Hard links will appear as regular files but will have the same inode number as the original file.
- You can use the `stat` command to see the inode number and link count of a file.
- Example: `stat original.txt` will show the number of hard links to that file.
