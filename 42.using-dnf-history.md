# Using DNF History

## What is DNF History?

- DNF History is a feature of the DNF package manager that allows you to view and manage the history of package transactions on your system.
- It keeps track of all package installations, updates, and removals, allowing you to easily review past actions and revert changes if necessary.
- This is particularly useful for troubleshooting issues that may arise after package changes.
- All transactions performed by DNF are logged-in `/var/lib/dnf/history/`.

## DNF History Commands

Here are some common DNF History commands:

- `dnf history`: Displays a list of all past transactions, including the transaction ID, date, action (install, update, remove), and the number of packages affected.
- `dnf history info <transaction_id>`: Provides detailed information about a specific transaction, including the packages involved and their versions.
- `dnf history undo <transaction_id>`: Reverts the changes made in a specific transaction. This is useful if a recent update caused issues.
- `dnf history redo <transaction_id>`: Reapplies the changes made in a specific transaction that was previously undone.
- `dnf history list <package_name>`: Lists all transactions involving a specific package, allowing you to see its history of installations, updates, and removals.
- `dnf history rollback <transaction_id>`: Rolls back the system to the state it was in before the specified transaction. This is a more comprehensive revert than `undo`.
