# Managing Packages

## Introduction

- Package management is a crucial aspect of maintaining a Linux system.
- It involves installing, updating, and removing software packages.
- Proper package management ensures that software is up-to-date, secure, and compatible with the system.
- In Red Hat-based distributions, RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) is the primary package management system.
- Tools like `yum` and `dnf` are commonly used to manage RPM packages.
- `dnf` is the next-generation package manager that has replaced `yum` in recent versions of RHEL.
