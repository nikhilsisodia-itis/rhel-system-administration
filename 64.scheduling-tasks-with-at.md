# Scheduling tasks with at

## What is at?

- At is a command-line utility that allows you to schedule a one-time task (command or script) to be executed at a specific time in the future.
- Unlike cron, which is used for recurring tasks, at is designed for tasks that need to be run only once.
- At jobs are not persistent and will not be executed if the system is powered off at the scheduled time.
- At jobs are defined using the `at` command followed by the desired time and the command to be executed.
- The at service must be running for scheduled tasks to work.

## Common commands

- `at [time]`: Schedule a command to be executed at the specified time.
- `atq`: List all pending at jobs for the current user.
- `atrm [job number]`: Remove a specific at job using its job number.
- `batch`: Schedule a command to be executed when the system load is low.
- `at -l`: List all pending at jobs (same as `atq`).
- `at -c [job number]`: Display the commands of a specific at job.
- `at -f [file] [time]`: Schedule commands from a file to be executed at the specified time.
- `at -m [time]`: Send an email notification when the job is completed.
- `at -d [job number]`: Delete a specific at job (same as `atrm`).
- `at -V`: Display the version of the at command.
- `at -q [queue]`: Specify a queue for the at job (default is 'a').
- `at -t [time]`: Specify the time in a specific format (e.g., `[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]`).

## Creating an at job

- To create an at job, use the `at` command followed by the desired time.

  ```bash
  at <TIME>
  ```

- After entering the command, you will be prompted to enter the commands you want to execute at the specified time. Type the commands and then press `Ctrl+D` to save and exit.

  ```bash
  at> echo "This is a scheduled task"
  at> <EOT>  # Press Ctrl+D here
  ```
