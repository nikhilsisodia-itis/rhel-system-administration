# Managing systemd Targets in RHEL

## Introduction to systemd Targets

- `systemd targets` are a way to group and manage system services and resources in RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
- They serve as synchronization points for starting and stopping services, similar to runlevels in traditional SysV init systems.
- Each target represents a specific state of the system, such as multi-user mode, graphical mode, or rescue mode.

## Common systemd Targets

- `graphical.target`: The default target for systems with a graphical user interface (GUI). It includes all services needed for multi-user mode plus the graphical interface.
- `multi-user.target`: A non-graphical target that provides a multi-user environment with networking capabilities.
- `rescue.target`: A minimal target used for system recovery, providing a single-user mode with essential services.
- `emergency.target`: The most minimal target, providing a shell for emergency repairs without starting any services.
- `default.target`: The default target that the system boots into, which is usually a symbolic link to either `graphical.target` or `multi-user.target`.

## Managing systemd Targets

### Viewing the Current Target

- To view the current target your system is running, use the following command:

```bash
systemctl get-default
```

- This will display the default target that the system is set to boot into.

### Changing the Default Target

- To change the default target, use the `systemctl set-default` command followed by the desired target name. For example, to set the default target to multi-user mode, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```

- To revert back to graphical mode, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

### Switching Targets Temporarily

- To switch to a different target temporarily without changing the default, use the `systemctl isolate` command. For example, to switch to rescue mode, run:

```bash
  sudo systemctl isolate rescue.target
```

- This command will stop all services not required by the specified target and start the necessary ones.

### Listing Available Targets

- To list all available targets on your system, use the following command:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=target
```

- This will display all the targets along with their current status.
