# Using UUID and Labels in RHEL

## What is UUID?

- UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier.
- It is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems.
- UUIDs are commonly used in software development, databases, and network protocols to ensure that identifiers are unique across different systems and contexts.
- UUIDs are generated using algorithms that ensure a very low probability of duplication, making them suitable for distributed systems where unique identification is crucial.
- In RHEL, UUIDs are often used to identify storage devices, network interfaces, and other system components.
- You can view the UUID of a filesystem using the `blkid` command or by checking the `/etc/fstab` file.

## What are Labels?

- Labels are human-readable names assigned to filesystems, devices, or other system components.
- They provide a more intuitive way to identify and manage resources compared to using UUIDs.
- Labels can be set during the creation of a filesystem or modified later using tools like `e2label -L` for ext filesystems or `tune2fs -L`, `xfs_admin -L` to modify XFS filesystems, `mkfs.* -L` to set labels during filesystem creation.
- In RHEL, labels can be used in the `/etc/fstab` file to mount filesystems by their labels instead of UUIDs or device names.
- This can make it easier to manage and identify filesystems, especially in environments where device names may change (e.g., when adding or removing disks).
- Users can view the labels of filesystems using the `blkid` command or by checking the `/etc/fstab` file.

## Using UUIDs and Labels in RHEL

- When configuring filesystems in RHEL, you can choose to use either UUIDs or labels in the `/etc/fstab` file for mounting.
- Using UUIDs ensures that the correct filesystem is mounted regardless of changes in device names, while using labels can provide a more user-friendly approach.
- It is important to ensure that UUIDs and labels are unique to avoid conflicts when mounting filesystems.
- You can use the `blkid` command to list the UUIDs and labels of all available filesystems on your system.
- Example of an `/etc/fstab` entry using UUID:

  ```bash
  UUID=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 2
  ```

- Example of an `/etc/fstab` entry using a label:

  ```bash
  LABEL=data /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 2
  ```

- Always ensure to back up your `/etc/fstab` file before making changes to avoid system boot issues.
- Use `sudo findmnt --verify --verbose` to check syntax errors in the `/etc/fstab` file after making changes.
- After making changes to `/etc/fstab`, you can test the configuration by running `mount -a` to mount all filesystems defined in the file without rebooting.
**Note:** When XFS filesystem is cloned, the UUID remains the same. It is recommended to change the UUID using `xfs_admin -U generate /dev/sdX` command to avoid conflicts.
