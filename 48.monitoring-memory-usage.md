# Monitoring Memory Usage

## Introduction

- Memory usage is a critical aspect of system performance. Monitoring memory usage helps in identifying memory leaks, optimizing application performance, and ensuring that the system runs efficiently.
- Linux places as many files as possible in Cache to guarantee fast access to the files.
- SWAP is used as an overflow area when the physical RAM is full. However, excessive swapping can lead to performance degradation.
- The Linux Kernel moves inactive applications to SWAP to free up RAM for active applications.
- Inactive cache memory will just be dropped.
- The `free` command provides a quick overview of memory usage, including total, used, free, shared, buffer/cache, and available memory.
- The `/proc/meminfo` file contains detailed information about memory usage, including total memory, free memory, available memory, buffers, cached memory, swap total, swap free, and more.

## Commands

- `free -h`: Displays memory usage in a human-readable format.
- `cat /proc/meminfo`: Displays detailed memory information.
- `free -m`: Displays memory usage in megabytes.
- `free -g`: Displays memory usage in gigabytes.
- `less /proc/meminfo`: Allows for easy navigation through the detailed memory information.
