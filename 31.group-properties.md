# Understanding Group Properties

## What are Group Properties?

- Group properties are settings and attributes that define a group's identity and permissions on a Linux system.
- Group properties are stored in the `/etc/group` file.
- They determine what resources a group can access and what actions its members can perform on the system.

## Key Group Properties

- Password: An 'x' indicates that the password is stored in the `/etc/gshadow` file.
- Group ID (GID): A unique numeric identifier for the group.
- Group Members: A comma-separated list of users who are members of the group.
