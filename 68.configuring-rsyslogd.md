# Configuring rsyslogd

## Introduction

- rsyslogd is a powerful and versatile syslog daemon used for logging system messages.
- It provides advanced features such as filtering, log rotation, and remote logging capabilities.
- Rsyslog needs the rsyslogd service to be running to function properly.
- The configuration file for rsyslogd is typically located at `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.
- Snap-in configuration files can be found in the `/etc/rsyslog.d/` directory.
- Each logger file contains three items:
  - Facility: The source of the log message (e.g., auth, cron, daemon).
  - Severity: The importance level of the log message (e.g., debug, info, notice, warning, err, crit, alert, emerg).
  - Destination: Where the log message should be sent (e.g., a file, a remote server, or a console).
- Log files normally are in /var/log.
- Use the `logger` command to create log messages manually from the command line.

## Basic Configuration

- To configure rsyslogd, edit the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file or create custom configuration files in the `/etc/rsyslog.d/` directory.
- A basic configuration line in the rsyslog configuration file looks like this:

  ```facility.severity    destination
  ```

- Example:

  ```bash
  auth.*    /var/log/auth.log
  ```

  This line logs all authentication-related messages to `/var/log/auth.log`.
- You can specify multiple facilities and severities using commas or wildcards. For example:

  ```bash
  *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none    /var/log/messages
  ```

  This line logs all messages with severity `info` or higher, except for mail, authpriv, and cron messages, to `/var/log/messages`.
- To log messages to a remote server, use the following syntax:

  ```bash
  *.*    @remote-server-address:514
  ```

  This line sends all log messages to the specified remote server on port 514.
- After making changes to the configuration file, restart the rsyslogd service to apply the changes:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
  ```
