# Managing User Sessions and Processes

## What are User Sessions and Processes in RHEL?

- A user session in RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) refers to the period during which a user is logged into the system and can interact with it.
- A process is an instance of a running program. Each user session can have multiple processes associated with it.
- Managing user sessions and processes is crucial for system administration, as it helps in resource allocation, security, and overall system performance.
- RHEL provides various tools and commands to monitor and manage user sessions and processes effectively.

## Managing User Sessions and Processes using `loginctl`

- `loginctl` : This command display all active user sessions on the system.
  - `loginctl list-sessions` : Lists all active sessions.
    - Example:
      `loginctl list-sessions`
  - `loginctl show-session <session-id>` : Displays detailed information about a specific session.
    - Example:
      `loginctl show-session 2`
  - `loginctl terminate-session <session-id>` : Terminates a specific user session.
    - Example:
      `loginctl terminate-session 2`
  - `loginctl lock-session <session-id>` : Locks a specific user session.
    - Example:
      `loginctl lock-session 2`
  - `loginctl unlock-session <session-id>` : Unlocks a specific user session.
    - Example:
      `loginctl unlock-session 2`
  - `loginctl kill-session <session-id>` : Kills all processes associated with a specific session.
    - Example:
      `loginctl kill-session 2`
  - `loginctl list-users` : Lists all users currently logged into the system.
    - Example:
      `loginctl list-users`
  - `loginctl show-user <user-id>` : Displays detailed information about a specific user
    - Example:
      `loginctl show-user 1000`
  - `loginctl enable-linger <user>` : Allows a user to run processes even when not logged in.
    - Example:
      `loginctl enable-linger username`
  - `loginctl disable-linger <user>` : Disables the linger feature for a user.
    - Example:
      `loginctl disable-linger username`
  - `loginctl user-status <user>` : Displays the status of a specific user, including active sessions and processes.
    - Example:
