# Using the Boot Debug Shell

The Boot Debug Shell is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with the boot process of an operating system. It provides a command-line interface to execute commands, inspect system states, and troubleshoot issues during the boot sequence.

## Accessing the Boot Debug Shell

To access the Boot Debug Shell, follow these steps:

1. Reboot your RHEL system.
2. When the GRUB menu appears, use the arrow keys to select the kernel you want to boot.
3. Press the `e` key to edit the selected kernel entry.
4. Find the line that starts with `linux` or `linux16`.
5. At the end of this line, add the word `systemd.debug-shell=1` to enable debugging features.
6. Press `Ctrl + X` or `F10` to boot with the modified parameters.
7. Once the system boots, you can access the Boot Debug Shell by switching to the debug shell terminal. This is typically done by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + F9`.
