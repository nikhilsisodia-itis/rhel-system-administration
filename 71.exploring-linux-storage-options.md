# Exploring Linux Storage Options

## Linux Storage Options

- Partitions:
  - Used to divide a physical disk into separate sections.
  - Each partition can be formatted with a different filesystem.
  - Common partition types include primary, extended, and logical partitions.
- Logical Volume Management (LVM):
  - Provides a flexible way to manage disk space.
  - Allows for resizing, creating, and deleting logical volumes without unmounting.
  - Supports features like snapshots and striping.
- Stratis:
  - A modern storage management solution for Linux.
  - Simplifies the management of storage pools and volumes.
  - Provides features like thin provisioning, snapshots, and data integrity checks.

## Linux block devices

- Block devices are storage devices that read and write data in fixed-size blocks.
- Common block devices include hard drives, SSDs, and USB drives.
- Block devices are represented in the `/dev` directory (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`).
- Different block devices are used according to the drivers available in the kernel.
- Block devices can be managed using tools like `fdisk`, `parted`, and `lsblk`.
- `/dev/sdx` is common for SCSI, SATA, and USB drives.
- `/dev/vdx` is used for virtual block devices in virtualized environments.
- `/dev/nvmeXnY` is used for NVMe drives.
- `/dev/mapper/` is used for LVM and device-mapper devices.
- `/dev/mdX` is used for software RAID devices.
- `/dev/loopX` is used for loopback devices, which allow files to be treated as block devices.

## Undersanding partition numbers

- Partitions are numbered starting from 1.
  - Example: `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sda2`, etc.
- The first partition on a disk is always numbered 1.
- Primary partitions are numbered 1 to 4.
  -Example: `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sda2`, `/dev/sda3`, `/dev/sda4`.
- Extended partitions are numbered 5 and above.
  - Example: `/dev/sda5`, `/dev/sda6`, etc.
- Secondary partition on the second hard drive start from 1 again.
  - Example: `/dev/sdb1`, `/dev/sdb2`, etc.
- Logical partitions within an extended partition are numbered starting from 5.
  - Example: `/dev/sda5`, `/dev/sda6`, etc.
- The partition number is appended to the device name.
  - Example: `/dev/sda` (device) + `1` (partition number) = `/dev/sda1` (first partition on the first disk).
- For NVMe drives, the partition number is appended after `p`.
  - Example: `/dev/nvme0n1p1` (first partition on the first NVMe drive).
- For loop devices, the partition number is appended directly.
  - Example: `/dev/loop0p1` (first partition on the first loop device).
