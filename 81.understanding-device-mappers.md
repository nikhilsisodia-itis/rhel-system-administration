# Understanding Devie Mappers

## What is a Device Mapper?

- A device mapper is a kernel component that provides a generic way to create virtual layers of block devices.
- It allows for the creation of logical volumes and other complex storage configurations by mapping physical storage devices to virtual devices.
- Device mappers are commonly used in Linux systems for managing storage.
- It is used by logical volumes, dm-crypt (for disk encryption), and other storage management tools.
- Device mapper generates non-persistent names, like `/dev/dm-0`, `/dev/dm-1`, etc., which can change after a reboot.
- Persistent names are provided as symbolic links through `/dev/mappers`, like `/dev/mapper/vg0-lv1`.
- Alternatively, users can use the LVM generated symbolic links, like `/dev/vg0/lv1`.
