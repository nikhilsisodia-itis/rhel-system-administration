# Using Signals

## What are Signals?

- Signals are messages sent to a process to notify it of events like stopping, pausing, or terminating.
- Each signal has a unique number and name (for example, SIGKILL or SIGTERM).
- Processes can handle, ignore, or perform default actions when they receive signals.

## What are Interruts?

- Interrupts are signals from hardware or software that tell the CPU to stop its current task and handle something urgent.
- In Linux, interrupts can pause a running process so the system can quickly respond to things like keyboard input or network activity.
- After handling the interrupt, the CPU returns to what it was doing before.

## Commands to kill a process(s)

- `kill`: Sends a signal to a process by PID (default is SIGTERM).
  - `kill -9 <PID>`: Sends SIGKILL (force kill, cannot be caught or ignored).
  - `kill -15 <PID>`: Sends SIGTERM (default, asks process to terminate gracefully).
  - `kill -l`: Lists all available signals.
  - `kill -s <SIGNAL> <PID>`: Sends a specific signal by name (e.g., `kill -s SIGSTOP <PID>`).
  - `kill --help`: Shows help for the command.

- `killall`: Kills all processes with a given name.
  - `killall <name>`: Sends SIGTERM to all processes with the name.
  - `killall -9 <name>`: Sends SIGKILL to all processes with the name.
  - `killall -u <user>`: Kills all processes owned by a user.
  - `killall -i <name>`: Asks for confirmation before killing.
  - `killall -v <name>`: Verbose output, shows what was killed.

- `pkill` Kills processes by name or other attributes.
  - `pkill <name>`: Kills all processes with the given name.
  - `pkill -u <user>`: Kills processes owned by a specific user.
  - `pkill -9 <name>`: Sends SIGKILL to processes with the given name.
  - `pkill -f <pattern>`: Matches against the full command line.
  - `pkill -n <name>`: Kills the newest matching process.
