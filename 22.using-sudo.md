# Using SUDO

## What is SUDO?

- SUDO stands for "superuser do" and is a command that allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.
- It is commonly used to perform administrative tasks without needing to log in as the root user.
- SUDO provides an audit trail of commands executed, which enhances security by allowing administrators to track user actions.
- It is configured through the `/etc/sudoers` file, which defines which users can run which commands as which users.
- To use SUDO, a user typically needs to enter their own password, not the root password.
- By editing the sudoers file using the `visudo` command, administrators can safely manage SUDO permissions.
