# Introduction to File Permissions

## What is File Permissions?

- File permissions are settings that determine who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.
- They are crucial for maintaining security and controlling access to files on a system.
- In Linux, file permissions are represented using a combination of letters and symbols.

## Permission Categories

- **User (u)**: The owner of the file.
- **Group (g)**: Users who are part of the file's group.
- **Others (o)**: All other users on the system.
- **All (a)**: Represents user, group, and others.

## Types of Permissions

- **Read (r)**: Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing the contents of a directory.
- **Write (w)**: Allows modifying or deleting a file or adding/removing files in a directory.
- **Execute (x)**: Allows running a file as a program or script, or accessing a directory and its contents.

## Viewing File Permissions

- Use the `ls -l` command to view file permissions in a detailed list format.
- Example output:

  ```bash
  -rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 1234 Jan 01 12:00 example.txt
  drwxr-xr-- 1 user group 1234 Jan 01 12:00 example_dir/

  ```

  - The first character indicates the file type (`-` for a regular file, `d` for a directory).
  - The next nine characters represent the permissions for user, group, and others.
  - In the example above, the owner has read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`), the group has read and execute permissions (`r-x`), and others have read-only permission (`r--`).
  - The numbers following the permissions indicate the number of links, owner, group, file size, and the last modification date and time, followed by the file or directory name.

## Numeric Representation of Permissions

- Permissions can also be represented numerically using octal values:
  - Read (r) = 4
  - Write (w) = 2
  - Execute (x) = 1
- To calculate the numeric value for a set of permissions, sum the values for each category:
  - Example: `rwxr-xr--` = 7 (4+2+1) for user, 5 (4+0+1) for group, and 4 (4+0+0) for others, resulting in `754`.
- Common numeric permission values:
  - `777`: Full permissions for everyone (rwxrwxrwx).
  - `755`: Full permissions for the owner, read and execute for group and others (rwxr-xr-x).
  - `644`: Read and write for the owner, read-only for group and others (rw-r--r--).
  - `600`: Read and write for the owner, no permissions for group and others (rw-------).
