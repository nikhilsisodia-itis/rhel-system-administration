# Masking Services

## What is Masking Services in RHEL?

- Masking a service in RHEL means to completely disable it, preventing it from being started manually or automatically. This is done by creating a symbolic link from the service's unit file to `/dev/null`.
- Masking is a stronger form of disabling a service compared to just stopping it, as it ensures that the service cannot be started again until it is unmasked.
- This is useful for services that you want to ensure are never run, either for security reasons or because they are not needed on your system.

## How to Mask a Service

To mask a service, you can use the `systemctl` command followed by the `mask` option and the name of the service you want to mask. For example, to mask the `httpd` service, you would run:

```bash
sudo systemctl mask httpd
```

This command creates a symbolic link from the `httpd` service unit file to `/dev/null`, effectively preventing it from being started.

## How to Unmask a Service

To unmask a service, you can use the `systemctl` command followed by the `unmask` option and the name of the service you want to unmask. For example, to unmask the `httpd` service, you would run:

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask httpd
```

This command removes the symbolic link from `/dev/null`, allowing the service to be started again.

## Checking the Status of a Service

You can check the status of a service using the `systemctl status` command followed by the name of the service. For example, to check the status of the `httpd` service, you would run:

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

This command will show you whether the service is active, inactive, masked, or in a failed state.
