# Modifying Systemd Service Configs

## What are Systemd Service Configs?

- Systemd service configs are files that define how services (background processes) are managed on a Linux system using the systemd init system.
- These files typically have a `.service` extension and are located in directories like `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/lib/systemd/system/`.
- They contain various directives that specify how and when a service should be started, stopped, restarted, and other behaviors.
- Custome unit or user-defined unit files can also be created to manage custom services.
- Custom unit files are usually stored in `/etc/systemd/system/` to override or extend the default service configurations.
- Run-time automatically generated unit files are stored in `/run/systemd/system/`.

**NOTE:** Avoid modifying the original service files in `/lib/systemd/system/` directly, as these can be overwritten during package updates. Instead, create override files or custom unit files in `/etc/systemd/system/`.

## Command to Modify Systemd Service Configs

- To modify a systemd service config, you can use the `systemctl edit` command. This command opens an editor where you can create or modify override files for the specified service.
- `sudo systemctl edit <service-name>.service`: Opens an editor to modify the service config for `<service-name>`. This creates an override file in `/etc/systemd/system/<service-name>.service.d/` if it doesn't already exist.
- `sudo systemctl show <service-name>.service`: Show the full content of the service config for `<service-name>`.
- `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`: Reloads the systemd manager configuration. This is necessary after modifying service files to apply the changes.
- `sudo systemctl restart <service-name>.service`: Restarts the specified service to apply any changes made to its configuration.
- `sudo systemctl status <service-name>.service`: Displays the current status of the specified service, including whether it is active, inactive, or failed.
