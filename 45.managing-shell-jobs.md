# Managing Shell Jobs

## Introduction

- Managing shell jobs is a process of controlling and monitoring tasks that are running in the background or foreground of a shell environment.
- Root user or owner of a job(s) can manage jobs.
- Managing jobs includes starting, stopping, pausing, resuming, and monitoring the status of jobs.

## Job Control Commands

- `fg`: Brings a background job to the foreground.
- `bg`: Resumes a stopped job in the background.
- `<commands> &`: Starts a command in the background.
- `ctrl + z`: Pauses the current foreground job and sends it to the background as a stopped job.
- `ctrl + c`: Terminates the current foreground job.
