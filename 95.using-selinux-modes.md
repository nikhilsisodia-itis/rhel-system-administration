# Using SELinux Modes

## Introduction

- SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security architecture integrated into the Linux kernel that provides mechanisms for supporting access control security policies.
- SELinux operates in three modes: Enforcing, Permissive, and Disabled.
- This guide will explain how to check the current SELinux mode and how to change it.

## Checking the Current SELinux Mode

- To check the current SELinux mode, you can use the following command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  sestatus
  ```

- The output will show the current mode under the "Current mode" section.
- Alternatively, you can use:

  ```bash
  getenforce
  ```

- This command will return one of the following:
  - `Enforcing`: SELinux is enforcing the security policies.
  - `Permissive`: SELinux is not enforcing policies but is logging actions that would have been denied.
  - `Disabled`: SELinux is turned off.

## Changing the SELinux Mode

- To change the SELinux mode temporarily (until the next reboot), you can use the `setenforce` command:

  ```bash
  sudo setenforce 1  # Set to Enforcing mode
  sudo setenforce 0  # Set to Permissive mode
  ```

- Note: You cannot set SELinux to Disabled mode using `setenforce`. To disable SELinux, you need to modify the configuration file.
- To change the SELinux mode permanently, you need to edit the SELinux configuration file located at `/etc/selinux/config`:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/selinux/config
  ```

- In the configuration file, find the line that starts with `SELINUX=` and change its value to one of the following:
  - `SELINUX=enforcing`  # To set SELinux to Enforcing mode
  - `SELINUX=permissive` # To set SELinux to Permissive mode
  - `SELINUX=disabled`   # To disable SELinux
- After making the changes, save the file and exit the editor.
- For the changes to take effect, you need to reboot your system.
