# Using Tuned Profiles

## What is Tuned Profiles in RHEL?

- Tuned is a daemon that tunes system settings dynamically based on the current usage.
- It provides various pre-defined profiles that can be applied to optimize system performance for specific workloads.
- Tuned profiles can be used to optimize for different scenarios such as desktop usage, server workloads, virtual machines, and more.
- It is particularly useful in RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) environments to ensure that systems are running efficiently.
- Tuned can be managed using the `tuned-adm` command-line tool.

## How to use Tuned Profiles?

- To check the current active profile, use the command:

  ```bash
  tuned-adm active
  ```

- To list all available profiles, use the command:

  ```bash
  tuned-adm list
  ```

- To switch to a different profile, use the command:

  ```bash
  sudo tuned-adm profile <profile_name>
  ```

  Replace `<profile_name>` with the desired profile from the list.

- To revert to the default profile, use the command:

  ```bash
  sudo tuned-adm profile default
  ```

- To create a custom profile, you can copy an existing profile and modify it according to your needs. Custom profiles are stored in `/etc/tuned/`.
- After creating or modifying a profile, restart the Tuned service to apply changes:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart tuned
  ```

- To check the status of the Tuned service, use the command:

  ```bash
  systemctl status tuned
  ```

- For more detailed information about a specific profile, you can view its configuration file located in `/usr/lib/tuned/<profile_name>/tuned.conf`.
- Always ensure that the Tuned service is enabled to start at boot:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable tuned
  ```
  
- Tuned profiles can be particularly beneficial in virtualized environments, where specific profiles like `virtual-guest` or `virtual-host` can optimize performance for virtual machines.
