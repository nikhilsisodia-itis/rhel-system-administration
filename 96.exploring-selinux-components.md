# Exploring SELinux Components

## What are SELinux Components?

- SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security architecture integrated into the Linux kernel that provides mechanisms for supporting access control security policies.
- It consists of several key components that work together to enforce security policies.

## Key Components of SELinux

1. **Security Policies**:
   - Define the rules and regulations for access control.
   - Specify what actions users and processes can perform on various system resources.
2. **Labels**:
   - Every file, process, and resource in an SELinux-enabled system is assigned a security label.
   - Labels consist of user, role, type, and level information that help determine access permissions.
3. **Type Enforcement (TE)**:
   - The primary mechanism used by SELinux to enforce access control.
   - It defines how types (labels) interact with each other and what operations are allowed.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Provides a way to assign permissions based on roles rather than individual users.
   - Helps in managing large systems by grouping permissions.
5. **Multi-Level Security (MLS)**:
   - An optional component that adds an additional layer of security by categorizing data and users into different levels.
   - Ensures that users can only access data at or below their clearance level.
6. **SELinux Policy Modules**:
   - Modular components that can be loaded or unloaded to modify the SELinux policy without affecting the entire system.
   - Allow for customization and flexibility in managing security policies.
7. **Audit System**:
   - Monitors and logs SELinux-related events.
   - Helps administrators track access violations and policy enforcement actions.
8. **Management Tools**:
   - Tools like `setenforce`, `getsebool`, and `semanage` are used to manage and configure SELinux settings.
   - Provide interfaces for administrators to interact with SELinux policies and components.
