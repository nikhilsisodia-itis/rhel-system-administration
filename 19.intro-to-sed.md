# Introduction to SED

## What is SED?

- SED (Stream Editor) in Linux is a powerful text processing tool used for parsing and transforming text in a data stream or file.
- It is commonly used for tasks like text substitution, deletion, insertion, and complex text xmanipulation.
- SED operates on a line-by-line basis, making it efficient for processing large text files.

## Basic Syntax

- The general syntax of a SED command is:

  ```bash
  sed 'command' input_file
  ```

  - Example:

    ```bash
    sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
    ```

    This command replaces all occurrences of "old" with "new" in `file.txt`.
- SED commands can be combined using semicolons or by using the `-e` option for multiple commands.
- You can also write SED scripts in a file and execute them using the `-f` option.
- Example:

  ```bash
  sed -f script.sed file.txt
  ```

  This command executes the SED commands in `script.sed` on `file.txt`.
