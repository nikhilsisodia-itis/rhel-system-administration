# Booting into a Specific Target in RHEL 10

## Introduction to Booting into Specific Targets

- In RHEL 10, you can boot into specific systemd targets to change the state of the system during startup.
- This is useful for troubleshooting, maintenance, or running the system in a minimal state.

## Steps to Boot into a Specific Target

1. **Access the GRUB Menu**:
    - Restart your system.
    - During the boot process, press the `Esc` key (or `Shift` key on some systems) to access the GRUB menu.
2. **Select the Kernel Entry**:
    - Use the arrow keys to highlight the desired kernel entry you want to boot.
3. **Edit the Kernel Parameters**:
    - Press the `e` key to edit the selected kernel entry.
    - This will bring up a text editor with the GRUB configuration for that entry.
4. **Modify the Target Parameter**:
    - Locate the line that starts with `linux` or `linux16`.
    - At the end of this line, add the parameter `systemd.unit=<target-name>`, replacing `<target-name>` with the desired target, such as `multi-user.target` or `rescue.target`.
    - For example, to boot into multi-user mode, you would append `systemd.unit=multi-user.target`.
5. **Boot with the Specified Target**:
    - After making the necessary changes, press `Ctrl + X` or `F10` to boot the system with the specified target.
    - The system will boot into the target you specified for that session only.

## Using `systemctl isolate` and `systemctl.unit` for Persistent Changes

- If you want to change the default target permanently, you can use the following commands after booting into the desired target:
- To change the default target:

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default <target-name>
```

- To switch to a different target immediately:

```bash
sudo systemctl isolate <target-name>
```

- Replace `<target-name>` with the desired target, such as `graphical.target` or `multi-user.target`.

## Common Targets in RHEL 10

- `graphical.target`: Boots into a graphical user interface.
- `multi-user.target`: Boots into a multi-user, non-graphical mode.
- `rescue.target`: Boots into a single-user mode for system recovery.
- `emergency.target`: Boots into a minimal environment for emergency repairs.
- `default.target`: The default target set for the system.
- `shutdown.target`: Shuts down the system.
- `reboot.target`: Reboots the system.
