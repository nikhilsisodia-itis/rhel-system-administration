# Introduction to Linux Filesystem

## What is a Filesystem?

- A filesystem is a method and data structure that an operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved on a storage device.
- Without a filesystem, data placed in a storage medium would be one large block of data with no way to tell where one piece of information stops and the next begins.
- By organizing data into files, which are then grouped into directories (also known as folders), filesystems make it easy to find and access the data you need.
- Filesystems also manage metadata, which includes information about files such as their size, type, permissions, and timestamps.
- Different filesystems have different features, performance characteristics, and limitations.
- Common types of filesystems include ext4, XFS, Btrfs, NTFS, and FAT32.

## Linux Filesystem Standards

- Linux filesystems adhere to certain standards to ensure compatibility and interoperability across different distributions and systems.
- The most widely adopted standard is the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems.
- According to FHS, the root directory file is denoted by a single forward slash (`/`), and all other directories files and files are organized under this root.
- It is logical or used for organizing files and directories in a hierarchical manner.
- Key directory files defined by FHS include:
  - `/bin`: Essential command binaries: Common user commands.
  - `/boot`: Static files of the boot loader: Files needed to boot the system.
  - `/dev`: Device files: Special files that represent hardware devices.
  - `/etc`: Host-specific system configuration: Configuration files for the system and applications, configured as per the specific host or user.
  - `/home`: User home directories: Personal directories for users.
  - `/lib`: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules: Libraries needed for basic system functionality.
  - `/media`: Mount point for removable media: A directory where removable media (like USB drives) are mounted.
  - `/mnt`: Mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems: A directory where filesystems can be mounted temporarily.
  - `/opt`: Optional application software packages: Add-on software packages.
  - `/proc`: Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files: A pseudo-filesystem that provides an interface to kernel data structures.
  - `/root`: Home directory for the root user: The personal directory for the system administrator.
  - `/run`: Runtime variable data: Data relevant to the running system since the last boot.
  - `/sbin`: System binaries: Essential system administration binaries.
  - `/srv`: Data for services provided by the system: Data for services like web and FTP servers.
  - `/sys`: Virtual filesystem providing system information: A pseudo-filesystem that provides information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.
  - `/tmp`: Temporary files: Files that are temporary and can be deleted after a certain period or on reboot.
  - `/usr`: Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data: Contains user applications and files.
  - `/var`: Variable data files: Files that are expected to change in size and content.
- Adhering to these standards helps maintain a consistent environment across different Linux systems, making it easier for users and administrators to navigate and manage files.
- In addition to FHS, Linux also supports various filesystem types, each with its own features and use cases. Common Linux filesystems include:
  - ext4: The default filesystem for many Linux distributions, known for its robustness and performance.
  - XFS: A high-performance filesystem suitable for large files and high-capacity storage systems.
  - Btrfs: A modern filesystem that offers advanced features like snapshots, checksums, and built-in RAID support.
  - Swap: A special filesystem used for virtual memory management.
- Use `man hier` to read more about the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
**Note:** FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) is used at the logical level to organize files and directories. The actual physical storage of files on disk is managed by the filesystem type (like ext4, XFS, etc.) used on the partitions of the storage device.
