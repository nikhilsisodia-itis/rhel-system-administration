# Finding Files

## Using the find Command

- `find` is a powerful command-line utility used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on various criteria such as name, type, size, modification date, and more.
- Basic syntax:

  ```bash
  find [path] [expression]
  ```

## Using the locate Command

- `locate` is a command that quickly finds files by searching a pre-built database of file names and paths.
- It is generally faster than `find` but may not reflect the most recent changes to the filesystem.
- Basic syntax:

  ```bash
  locate [pattern]
  ```

- To use `locate`, you may need to install it first using the: `sudo dnf install plocate` command and update the database using `sudo updatedb`.
