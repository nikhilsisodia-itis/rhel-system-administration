# Introduction to LVM

## What is LVM?

- LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a tool in Linux for managing disk space more flexibly.
- It lets users combine multiple physical disks into one big storage pool.
- Users can create, resize, or delete storage areas (called logical volumes) easily, even while the system is running.
- LVM makes it simple to add more storage to your system without downtime.
- Users can take snapshots (backups) of their data quickly using LVM.
- It helps organize and separate data, like keeping system files and user files on different volumes.
- LVM is useful for servers and desktops where storage needs can change over time.
- It provides better performance and reliability by spreading data across multiple disks.
- LVM is widely used in Linux systems for efficient disk management.
