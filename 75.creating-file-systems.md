# Creating File Systems

## How to create file system on RHEL?

- `mkfs` is used to create a file system on a partition or logical volume.
- The basic syntax is: `mkfs -t <filesystem_type> <device>`
- Example to create an ext4 file system on `/dev/sdb1`:

  ```bash
  mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1
  ```

- `t` specifies the type of file system you want to create (e.g., ext4, xfs, vfat, btrfs).
- `device` is the partition or logical volume on which you want to create the file system.
- `mkfs[tab][tab]` can be used to see the available file system types.
- You can also use specific commands for different file systems:
  - For ext4: `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1`
  - For vfat: `mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1`
  - For btrfs: `mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb1`

**NOTE:** Always ensure that the device is not mounted and does not contain any important data before creating a file system, as this process will erase all existing data on the device.
