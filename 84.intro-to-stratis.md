# Introduction to Stratis

## What is Stratis in Linux?

- Stratis is a local storage management solution for Linux that simplifies the management of storage devices.
- It provides a higher-level interface for managing storage pools, filesystems, and snapshots.
- Stratis aims to make it easier for system administrators to manage storage by providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- It is designed to work with existing Linux storage technologies like LVM (Logical Volume Manager) and XFS (a high-performance filesystem).
- Stratis is built on top of D-Bus, which allows for easy integration with other system components and tools.
- It is particularly useful for managing large amounts of data and complex storage configurations.
- Stratis is open-source and actively developed by Red Hat and the Linux community.
