# Introduction to Linux Commands

## What are Linux Commands?

- Linux commands are the building blocks for interacting with the shell and performing various tasks.
- Commands are typically entered in the terminal and can be combined with options and arguments to modify their behavior.
- Commands are then interpreted and executed by the shell.

## Parts of a Command

- The command name is the name of the program or utility that you want to run.
- Options (or flags) are optional parameters that modify the behavior of the command. They usually start with a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--).
- Arguments are the input or target for the command, such as file names or directories.
  - Example: In the command `ls -l /home/user`, `ls` is the command name, `-l` is an option or flag, and `/home/user` is an argument or input on which the command operates.

## The `man` command

- The `man` command is used to display the manual pages for other commands, providing detailed information about their usage and options.
- Example: `man ls`
- Use `/` to search within the manual page.
- Press `n` to jump to the next search result and `N` to jump to the previous one.
- Press `q` to quit the manual page.
- Use `h` for help within the manual page.
- The `man` documentation is organized in sections, each covering a different aspect of the command.
  - Section 1: User Commands: Commands that can be executed by users.
  - Section 2: System Calls: Functions that the kernel provides to user programs.
  - Section 3: Library Functions: Functions that are part of programming libraries.
  - Section 4: Special Files: Files that represent hardware devices or other special resources.
  - Section 5: File Formats and Conventions: Descriptions of file formats and conventions.
  - Section 6: Games: Documentation for games and other recreational programs.
  - Section 7: Miscellaneous: Various other topics not covered in other sections.
  - Section 8: System Administration Commands: Commands for system administration tasks.
- Use `man man` command to view the manual for the `man` command itself.
- To view a specific section, use the section number followed by the command name, e.g., `man 1 man` or `man man.1`.
- Section 1, 5, 8 are the most commonly used sections for Administration tasks.
- The `man -k <keyword>` command can be used to search for commands related to a specific keyword.

## The `--help` flag

- Use the `--help` option with any command to display its help information and usage instructions.
  - Example: `ls --help`
- This is a quick way to get an overview of the command's options and arguments without accessing the full manual page.
