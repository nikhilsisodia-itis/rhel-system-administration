# Mounting Partition with /etc/fstab

## Introduction

- /etc/fstab is a configuration file that contains information about disk drives and partitions and how they should be mounted in the filesystem.
- It is used by the system to automatically mount filesystems at boot time or when the `mount -a` command is executed.
- The file is typically located at `/etc/fstab`.
- Each line in the file represents a filesystem and contains several fields that specify how the filesystem should be mounted.
- The fields in each line of /etc/fstab are as follows:
  1. **Device**: The device file or UUID of the partition to be mounted (e.g., `/dev/sda1`, `UUID=xxxx-xxxx`).
  2. **Mount Point**: The directory where the filesystem will be mounted (e.g., `/mnt/data`).
  3. **Filesystem Type**: The type of filesystem (e.g., `ext4`, `ntfs`, `vfat`).
  4. **Options**: Mount options that control how the filesystem is mounted (e.g., `defaults`, `ro`, `noatime`).
  5. **Dump**: A number indicating whether the filesystem should be backed up by the dump utility (0 = no, 1 = yes).
  6. **Pass**: A number indicating the order in which filesystems should be checked at boot time (0 = no check, 1 = root filesystem, 2 = other filesystems).

## How to Mount a Partition Using /etc/fstab

- Identify the partition you want to mount using commands like `lsblk` or `fdisk -l`.
- Create a mount point directory if it doesn't already exist, e.g., `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data`.
- Open the /etc/fstab file in a text editor with superuser privileges, e.g., `sudo nano /etc/fstab`.
- Add a new line to the file with the appropriate fields. For example:
  
  ```nano
  /dev/sda1   /mnt/data   ext4   defaults   0   0
  ```

- Save the file and exit the text editor.
- To apply the changes and mount all filesystems listed in /etc/fstab, run the command:
  
  ```bash
  sudo mount -a
  ```
  
  - This command will mount all filesystems specified in /etc/fstab that are not currently mounted.
- Verify that the partition is mounted correctly by using the `df -h` or `mount` command.
- The partition should now be automatically mounted at boot time according to the configuration in /etc/fstab.
