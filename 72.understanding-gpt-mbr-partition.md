# Understanding GPT and MBR Partitioning

When setting up a new hard drive or SSD, one of the first decisions to make is how to partition the drive. The two most common partitioning schemes are **MBR (Master Boot Record)** and **GPT (GUID Partition Table)**. Understanding the differences between these two can help choose the right one as per needed.

## MBR (Master Boot Record)

- MBR is an older partitioning scheme that has been around since the early days of PC computing.
- It uses a 32-bit addressing scheme, which limits the maximum disk size to 2 TB.
- It has 512 bytes to store boot information, and 64 bytes to store partition information.
- MBR supports up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and one extended partition.
- The partition table is stored in the first sector of the disk, making it vulnerable to corruption.

## GPT (GUID Partition Table)

- GPT is a newer partitioning scheme that is part of the UEFI standard.
- It uses a 64-bit addressing scheme, allowing for much larger disk sizes (up to 9.4 ZB).
- GPT supports a nearly unlimited number of partitions (theoretically up to 128).
- GPT can have maximum 128 partitions.
- The partition table is stored in multiple locations on the disk, providing redundancy and protection against corruption.

## Choosing Between MBR and GPT

- If you're working with a disk larger than 2 TB or need more than four partitions, GPT is the better choice.
- If you're using an older system that doesn't support UEFI, you may need to stick with MBR.
- Always back up your data before making changes to disk partitions, regardless of the scheme you choose.
