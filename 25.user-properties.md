# Understanding User Properties

## What are User Properties?

- User properties are settings and attributes that define a user's identity and permissions on a Linux system.
- User properties are stored in system files like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`.
- They determine what resources a user can access and what actions they can perform on the system.

## Key User Properties

- **Username and User ID (UID):** Each user has a unique name and a number (UID) that the system uses to identify them.
- **Home Directory:** Every user gets a personal folder (home directory) to store their files and settings.
- **Permissions and Groups:** User properties include what the user can access or change, and which groups they belong to for shared access.
- **Shell:** The command-line interface that the user interacts with, such as bash or zsh.
- **Password:** A secure string that authenticates the user's identity.
- **Login Shell:** The default shell that is started when the user logs in.
- **User Groups:** Users can belong to one or more groups, which help manage permissions for shared resources.
- **User Comments:** Additional information about the user, often used for administrative purposes.
