# Understanding Process States

## What is a Process State in Linux?

- Process state refers to the current status of a process in an operating system.
- It indicates what the process is doing at a specific point in time.
- Once, a new process is started(forked), it is scheduled by the kernel to run on the CPU.
- The kernel manages the execution of processes and transitions them between different states based on their activity and resource requirements.
- Common process states include:
  - Running (R): The process is currently executing.
  - Sleeping (S): The process is waiting for an event or resource.
  - Stopped (T): The process has been halted, usually by a signal.
  - Zombie (Z): The process has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.
  - Exit or Dead (X): The process has terminated and is no longer in the process table.
- Each state provides insight into the behavior and performance of processes.
- Tools like `ps`, `top`, and `htop` can be used to monitor process states in real-time.

## User vs Kernel Space

- User Space:
  - This is where user applications and processes run.
  - It is a restricted area of memory that prevents direct access to hardware and critical system resources.
  - Processes in user space operate with limited privileges to ensure system stability and security.
  - Examples of user space applications include web browsers, text editors, and games.

- Kernel Space:
  - This is where the core of the operating system (the kernel) operates.
  - It has full access to all system resources, including hardware and memory.
  - The kernel manages system calls, process scheduling, memory management, and hardware interactions.
  - Processes in kernel space run with elevated privileges to perform critical tasks that require direct access to system resources.
  - Examples of kernel space activities include handling interrupts, managing device drivers, and performing low-level system operations.

## The Waiting Process

- A waiting process is a process that is not currently executing but is waiting for a specific event or resource to become available.
- This state is also known as "sleeping" or "blocked."
- Flags:
  - TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE (S): The process can be interrupted by signals while waiting.
  - TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE (D): The process cannot be interrupted by signals while waiting.
  - TASK_KILLABLE (K): The process can be killed while waiting.
  - TASK_REPORT_IDLE (I): The process is reporting its idle status while waiting.
