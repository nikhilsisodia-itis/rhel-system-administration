# Observing CPU Load

## Introduction

- CPU load is a measure of the amount of computational work that a computer system is performing. It is typically represented as a percentage of the CPU's capacity being used at a given time.
- Monitoring CPU load is crucial for system administrators and developers to ensure optimal performance, identify bottlenecks, and prevent system overloads.
- High CPU load can lead to slow response times, application crashes, and overall system instability.
- CPU load is checked through the `uptime` command.
- CPU load is expresses as the average number of runnable processes over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
- The `lscpu` command is used to check the number of CPU cores.
- A general rule of thumb is that a CPU load average equal to the number of CPU cores indicates full utilization, while a load average significantly higher than the number of cores may indicate that the system is overloaded.

## Scheduling in Linux

- Linux uses a scheduling algorithm to manage how processes are assigned to CPU cores.
- The scheduler aims to maximize CPU utilization and ensure fair distribution of CPU time among processes.
- When the CPU load is high, the scheduler may need to switch between processes more frequently, which can lead to increased context switching and reduced performance.
- The Linux kernel uses a Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) to manage process scheduling.
- CFS aims to allocate CPU time fairly among all processes, ensuring that each process gets a proportionate share of CPU time based on its priority and workload.
