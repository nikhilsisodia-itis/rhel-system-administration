# Using Subscription Manager

## What is Subscription Manager?

- Subscription Manager is a tool used to manage subscriptions and entitlements for Red Hat-based systems, including RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and its derivatives.
- It allows you to register your system with Red Hat, attach subscriptions, and manage the repositories that your system can access.
- This is essential for receiving updates, patches, and support from Red Hat.
- Subscription Manager is typically used in enterprise environments where systems need to be compliant with licensing and subscription requirements.
- The tool interacts with the Red Hat Customer Portal to verify and manage subscriptions.
- Subscription Manager is installed by default on RHEL systems and can be accessed via the command line.
