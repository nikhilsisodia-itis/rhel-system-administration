# The `ps` command

## Introduction

- The `ps` command is used to display information about active processes on a Unix-like operating system.
- It provides a snapshot of the current processes, including their process IDs (PIDs), terminals, CPU and memory usage, and more.
- The command is commonly used for monitoring system performance, managing processes, and troubleshooting issues.

## BSD VS System V

- There are two main variants of the `ps` command: BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) and System V (SysV).
- The BSD version is more commonly used on systems like FreeBSD, macOS, and some Linux distributions.
- The SysV version is often found on older Unix systems and some Linux distributions.
- The syntax and options for the two versions can differ significantly, so it's important to know which version you are using.
- You can usually determine the version by checking the man pages (`man ps`) or by looking at the command's help output (`ps --help`).
- Some systems may support both versions, allowing users to choose the one that best fits their needs.

## Common Options

- `ps aux`: Displays all processes for all users in a detailed format (BSD style).
- `ps fax`: Displays all running processes in a tree-like (hierarchical) format, showing the parent-child relationships between processes.
- `ps -ef`: Displays all processes in a full-format listing (SysV style).
- `ps -u <username>`: Shows processes for a specific user.
- `ps -p <pid>`: Displays information for a specific process ID.
- `ps -o <format>`: Customizes the output format by specifying which columns to display.
- `ps -C <command>`: Lists processes by command name.
- `ps --sort <key>`: Sorts the output based on a specified key (e.g., CPU or memory usage).
- `ps -H`: Displays processes in a hierarchical format, showing parent-child relationships.
- `ps -l`: Provides a long listing format with additional details about each process.
