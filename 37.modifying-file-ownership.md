# Modifying File Ownership

## Commands to modify file ownership

- `chown` command: Change the owner & group of a file.
  - `chown <owner>:<group> <file_name>`: Change the owner and group of a file.
    - Example: `chown alice:developers report.txt` changes the owner to `alice` and the group to `developers`.
  - `chown -R <owner>:<group> <directory_name>`: Change the owner and group of a directory recursively.
    - Example: `chown -R bob:admins /var/www` changes the owner to `bob` and the group to `admins` for all files and subdirectories in `/var/www`.
  - `chown id <owner>:<group> <file_name>`: Change the owner and group of a file by ID.
    - Example: `chown 1001:1002 report.txt` changes the owner to the user with UID `1001` and the group to the group with GID `1002`.
- Only root can change the owner and group of a file.
- A non-privileged user can only change the group of a file to a group that the user is a member of.
