# Breaking the root password in RHEL 10

- Sometimes, you may need to reset the root password on a RHEL 10 system, especially if it has been forgotten. This guide will walk you through the steps to break the root password by booting into single-user mode.

## Steps to Break the Root Password

1. **Reboot the System**: Start by rebooting your RHEL 10 system. You can do this by using the command:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

2. **Access the GRUB Menu**: During the boot process, when the GRUB menu appears, quickly press the `e` key to edit the boot parameters.
3. **Modify the Boot Parameters**: In the GRUB editor, locate the line that starts with `linux` or `linux16`. At the end of this line, append the following parameters:

   ```bash
   init=/bin/bash
   ```

    - This will instruct the system to boot directly into a bash shell.
4. **Boot into Single-User Mode**: After modifying the boot parameters, press `Ctrl + X` or `F10` to boot the system with the new parameters.
5. **Remount the Filesystem**: Once you are in the bash shell, the root filesystem will be mounted as read-only. You need to remount it as read-write by executing:

   ```bash
   mount -o remount,rw /
   ```

6. **Change the Root Password**: Now, you can change the root password by using the `passwd` command:

   ```bash
    passwd
   ```

    - You will be prompted to enter a new password for the root user. Type the new password and confirm it.
7. **Create a New SELinux Context**: If SELinux is enabled on your system, you need to create a new SELinux context for the root filesystem by running:

   ```bash
   touch /.autorelabel
   ```

8. **Execute the `/sbin/init**: To continue the normal boot process, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   exec /sbin/init
   ```

9. **Reboot the System**: After the system has booted normally, you can log in as root using the new password you set earlier.
