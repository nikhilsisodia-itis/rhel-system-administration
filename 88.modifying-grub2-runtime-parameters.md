# Modifying GRUB2 Runtime Parameters in RHEL 10

## Introduction to GRUB2 Runtime Parameters

- GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader version 2) is the default bootloader for RHEL 10.
- Runtime parameters can be modified to change the behavior of the kernel during boot without permanently altering the GRUB configuration files.
- This is useful for testing new kernel parameters or troubleshooting boot issues.

## Steps to Modify GRUB2 Runtime Parameters

1. **Access the GRUB Menu**:
   - Restart your system.
   - During the boot process, press the `Esc` key (or `Shift` key on some systems) to access the GRUB menu.
2. **Select the Kernel Entry**:
   - Use the arrow keys to highlight the desired kernel entry you want to modify.
3. **Edit the Kernel Parameters**:
   - Press the `e` key to edit the selected kernel entry.
   - This will bring up a text editor with the GRUB configuration for that entry.
4. **Modify the Parameters**:
   - Locate the line that starts with `linux` or `linux16`.
   - At the end of this line, you can add or modify kernel parameters as needed.
   - For example, to add a parameter to disable IPv6, you would append `ipv6.disable=1`.
5. **Boot with Modified Parameters**:
   - After making the necessary changes, press `Ctrl + X` or `F10` to boot the system with the modified parameters.
   - The changes will only apply for this boot session and will not be saved permanently.

## Important Considerations

- Changes made through the GRUB menu are temporary and will be lost after a reboot.
- To make permanent changes, you need to edit the `/etc/default/grub` file and then regenerate the GRUB configuration using the `grub2-mkconfig` command.
- Always be cautious when modifying kernel parameters, as incorrect settings can lead to boot failures or system instability.
