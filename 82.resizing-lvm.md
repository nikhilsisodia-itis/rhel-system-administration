# Resizing LVMs

## Introduction

- LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows for flexible disk management by enabling the resizing of logical volumes.
- Resizing can be done to either increase or decrease the size of a logical volume.
- This guide covers the steps to resize LVMs safely.

## Resizing Logical Volumes

- Before resizing, ensure you have a backup of important data.
- Use the `lvdisplay` command to check the current size of the logical volume.
- To increase the size of a logical volume, use the `lvextend` command:

  ```bash
  lvextend -r -L +<size> /dev/<volume_group>/<logical_volume>
  ```

  - Replace `<size>` with the amount you want to increase (e.g., `10G` for 10 gigabytes).
  - Replace `<volume_group>` and `<logical_volume>` with the appropriate names.
  - The `-r` option automatically resizes the filesystem to use the new space.
  
- To decrease the size of a logical volume, first unmount the filesystem:

  ```bash
  umount /dev/<volume_group>/<logical_volume>
  ```

- Then, use the `lvreduce` command:

  ```bash
  lvreduce -r -L -<size> /dev/<volume_group>/<logical_volume>
  ```

  - Replace `<size>` with the amount you want to decrease.
  - The `-r` option automatically resizes the filesystem.
- After reducing the size, remount the filesystem:

  ```bash
  mount /dev/<volume_group>/<logical_volume> /mount/point
  ```

- Always verify the changes using `lvdisplay` and check the filesystem integrity with `fsck` if necessary.
