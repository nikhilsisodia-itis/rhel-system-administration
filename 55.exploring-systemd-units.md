# Exploring `systemd` units

## What is `systemd`?

- `systemd` is the first process after the kernel is loaded.
- It is responsible for initializing the system, managing services, and handling system resources.
- It acts as the manager of everything on the system.
- Used for starting, stopping, and managing services and daemons.
- Items that are managed by `systemd` are called "units".
- Units can represent services, mount points, devices, sockets, and more.
- `systemd` uses unit files to define how these units behave.
- Unit files are typically located in `/etc/systemd/system/` and `/lib/systemd/system/`.
- Common unit types include:
  - Service units (`.service`): Define services and daemons.
  - Socket units (`.socket`): Define network sockets.
  - Mount units (`.mount`): Define mount points for filesystems.
  - Timer units (`.timer`): Define scheduled tasks.
  - Target units (`.target`): Group other units together.
- `systemctl` is the command-line tool used to interact with `systemd`.
